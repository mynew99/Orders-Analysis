# Orders-Analysis
Here is another PowerBi dashboard on "Orders Analysis".
I have used a power query editor for data cleaning and Dax to subtract dates to extract AVG days to use Data type any sow whole values to do better analysis.

Here are the insights:
-year
-Quantity
-Shipping Days
-packing Days
-Invoice Days
-Top orders customers
-low orders customers
-Top product name
-low product name
